# TransitEquity-Gupta
 Transportation Equity and Accessibility in Calgary
Project Name: Transportation Equity and Accessibility

Project Purpose and Objectives:
This project evaluates the accessibility and equity of Calgary's public transit system. By identifying transit deserts and analyzing disparities in transit availability, the study provides insights into urban sustainability, equity, and mobility. The objective is to guide urban planning toward inclusive and sustainable development.

Files derived from post-spatial analysis conducted in ArcGIS Pro, which provides insights into transit accessibility and equity in Calgary, have been uploaded to the repository. These files include Calgary Transit Stops, Calgary Transit Routes, Census by Community (2019), and Community Sectors.

Included detailed maps, data visualizations, and results for comprehensive evaluation. (File Names: Map1_TransitDensification.pdf, Map2_TransitServiceAreas.pdf, Map3_CensusPopulationTransitAccessibility.pdf).
